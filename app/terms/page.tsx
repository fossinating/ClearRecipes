                However, we recognize that it is fully within your right to utilize a form of ad blocker, in which case unpaid UNC related ads may be shown as a backup.
                These ads do not provide any revenue, nor do they utilize any form of tracking, they were created by student-run clubs and organizations at UNC.
                If you run a club and are interested in having it advertised here, please reach out to us on Twitter or Instagram @Recipe App.
