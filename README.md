# Clear Recipes

This is a project developed by [@fossinating](https://github.com/fossinating) and [@krohan03](https://github.com/krohan03) as a part of the 2023 HackNC hackathon. It was designed to assist people with dietary restrictions in finding recipes that can work for them.

## Current Features

## Planned features
